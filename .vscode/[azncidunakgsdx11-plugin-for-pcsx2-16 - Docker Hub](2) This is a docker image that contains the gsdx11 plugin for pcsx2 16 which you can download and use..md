# How to use GSdx11 plugin for PCSX2 16
 
PCSX2 is a popular PlayStation 2 emulator for Windows and Linux, that allows you to play PS2 games on your PC with enhanced graphics and performance. One of the most important components of PCSX2 is the graphics (GS) plugin, which can greatly affect the quality and speed of your emulation.
 
GSdx is the most well-known and widely used GS plugin for PCSX2, developed by Gabest. It supports both DirectX and OpenGL APIs, and can switch between hardware and software rendering modes. Hardware rendering uses your graphics card to render the picture, which is faster and offers more features, such as high resolution, anti-aliasing, texture filtering, etc. Software rendering uses your CPU to render the picture, which is slower but more accurate and compatible with some games.

GSdx has several versions that are optimized for different CPU instruction sets, such as SSE2, SSE4, and AVX2. The higher the instruction set, the more efficient and faster the plugin will be. However, your CPU must support the instruction set you choose, otherwise PCSX2 will not run or ask you to select a different plugin.
 
GSdx also has different versions that are compatible with different DirectX versions, such as GSdx9, GSdx10, and GSdx11. The higher the DirectX version, the more features and improvements the plugin will have. However, your graphics card must support the DirectX version you choose, otherwise PCSX2 will not run or ask you to select a different plugin.
